features:
  - heading: Faster Learning of New C# Features
    image_path: /images/features/faster-learning.svg
    tagline: Learn new C# features faster by applying them to your existing code base.
    copy: Forget the simplified, artificial code samples often used to introduce new C# features. Sharpen points to places in real-life production code, your code!, where new C# features should be used.

  - heading: Critical Approach to New C# Features
    image_path: /images/features/critical-approach.svg
    tagline: Learn to ❤ C# but not blindly. Take love with a pinch of salt ;-)
    copy: Sharpen brings a critical view on C# features. It recommends applying them only if their usage will actually result in "sharper" code. Sharpen is not shy of saying No to a language feature.

  - heading: Consistent Usage of C# Features
    image_path: /images/features/consistent-usage.svg
    tagline: Consistency matters. Your preferences as well.
    copy: Once configured on your project, Sharpen ensures that C# language features are consistently used over the whole code base. 

  - heading: Code Refactorings on Arbitrary Scale
    image_path: /images/features/code-refactorings.svg
    tagline: Safely refactor your code by a single mouse click.
    copy: Sharpen can refactor your code on an arbitrary scale. At the same time it gives you full control over the scope and nature of the refactorings.

  - heading: Improving the Design on a Larger Scope
    image_path: /images/features/improving-the-design.svg
    tagline: Still having BackgroundWorkers in your code?
    copy: It's time to replace them with async-await! Sharpen comes with an intelligent heuristics that recognizes potential improvements of your code base on a larger scope.

  - heading: Extensive Documentation on C# Language
    image_path: /images/features/extensive-documentation.svg
    tagline: Tired of searching for new C# features in random blog posts?
    copy: Sharpen comes with a built-in extensive documentation on C# language features. It's a one-stop-shop for everything you ever wanted to know about the design and evolution of C#.

    copy: "Take a look at the Sharpen Results view. Compare the existing and the \"sharper\" code. Use built-in C# documentation and Sharpen's suggestons to learn more about new C# features."
    disclaimer: "Inline comparison and built-in documentation are still a work in progress."

  - heading: "4. Refactor the Code"

    disclaimer: "Refactoring is still a work in progress."
