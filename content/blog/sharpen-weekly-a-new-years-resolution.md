# A Blog Post per Week
It's New Year's Eve here in Guadeloupe. Less then two hours to midnight. A perfect time for a good [New Year's resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution).

If you've ever tried to write blog posts on a constant pace, you've mostly likely had New Year's resolutions similar to this one:

[![New Year's resolution - Blogging once a week](/images/blog/sharpen-weekly-a-new-years-resolution/new-years-resolution-blogging-once-a-week.png)](http://blog.dingle.fi/en/2014/01/01/new-years-resolution-the-harder-the-better)

And you most likely failed ;-) At least I did. Although, knowing myself I never targeted that high. A blog post once a month would make me perfectly happy. But even that proved to be too difficult for me. For the last two years, I'm keeping the pace of [one programming blog post per year](http://thehumbleprogrammer.com/) :-)

It's New Year's Eve here in Guadeloupe. Less then two hours to midnight. A perfect time for a good [New Year's resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_resolution).

Sharpen is worth regularly blogging about. Especially the findings I discovered in real-life code while using it. Therefore, my New Year's resolution for 2018:

> Every week I will publish one blog post as a part of a blog post series called "Sharpen Weekly". Each blog post will demonstrate and discuss an example of a real-life C# code pointed out by one of Sharpen's suggestions.

Happy New Year everyone!! :-) :-)
